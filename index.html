        <h1>Hannie and Jetti</h1>
        <div class="row2">
            <div class="blog-left">
                    <h2>Jetti's Perspective</h2>
                    <p> Hannie and Jetti met at a local church named Hosanna World Mission Church. Jetti had a little crush on Hannie back then, but things seemed a bit impossible at the time. He grabbed any opportunity to talk to her, but he felt hopeless. She wouldn’t respond with enthusiasm—HAHAHAHA. So, Jetti focused on his priorities, such as school, church, and God. He prayed for wisdom to understand what the Lord wanted him to see. He concentrated on the tasks given to him until one day, she asked to talk to him. Nervous and brimming with anxiety, Jetti wanted to protect his heart because of his past mistakes. He intended to be cold in response to her. When the day of their meetup came, he found such a precious woman. She was amazing, smart, pretty, into K-pop, and lovely. The old crush he had once felt for her slowly returned. However, he kept it hidden because she genuinely needed someone to talk to, and he didn't want to take advantage of her. On their second date, he confessed that he used to have a small crush on her. She didn't seem to mind and continued being with him; it was a relief, really. </p> 
                    <br> 
                    <p> As time went by, they went on more dates and learned more about each other as the days passed. I fell more in love with Hannie, and I prayed to God that if she wasn't the one I'd been asking for all this time, He would allow His ways to work. But, if there was even a little chance that it was her, I would wait a little longer. You are my answered prayer, Hannie, don't ever doubt that! I love you, and I hope to spend my joys, sorrows, and maybe a little bit of anger and annoyance with you. Our bonding time is eating and spending time together. I'm sorry I haven't given you much time lately because I've been trying to learn some new things. I'll make it up to you, I promise—HEHEHEHEH.</p> 
                    <br>
                    <p> My message for you is to keep going, always, Bebi. Even if you feel like everyone is against you, remember that the Lord is always for you. As long as you do things to glorify Him, expect good things that He will prepare for you. I really appreciate everything you do for me—from gifts to acts of service, and even the time and money you spend on our bonding. Thank you, Bebi! I'll do my best to support you in the things that will help you grow and bring glory to the Lord. Also, I want you to cut back on soft drinks! HAHA! You've had a history with UTI, and I want our time together to be longer in the future. Likewise, I'll take care of myself and control the things that might harm my health.</p> <br> 
                    <p> I love you, Bebi, and you are always included in my prayers. There's no other girl in my prayers—HAHAHAHAHA. I have specific prayers for us, but I’ll only tell you once they come true! Another thing, I want you to be closer to God too. Even though we do things to glorify Him, I learned that I was becoming like Martha, serving only His kingdom and not the King Himself. I didn't have a relationship with Him before, but I truly got to know Him through the Bible and prayer. Bebi do the same, okay?</p> 
                    <br> 
                    <p> And also! Be honest with yourself and find some friends you can trust and safely share your feelings with. Pray for those kinds of people because they are super rare. Regarding career and possessions, I know you will prosper—HAHAHAHAHA. Don't worry too much about money; just explore things, but make sure that exploration is focused on what glorifies the Lord! My financial advice is to invest in real estate! HAHAHAHAHA. The return is great as time passes by, and it would be wonderful to have your own house. We can even build you a walk-in closet because I know you like having lots of clothes.</p> 
                    <br> 
                    <p> That's all, Bebi. Stay safe always and take care of yourself. My parents, siblings and ME already loves you, and I hope we can achieve our dreams together!</p>
